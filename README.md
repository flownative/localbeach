# Local Beach

Local Beach is a development environment for [Neos CMS](https://www.neos.io) and [Flow Framework](https://flow.neos.io).
Under the hood, it's using Docker, and the official Beach Docker images (Nginx, PHP and Redis). You don't need a Beach
account nor be a  [Flownative](https://www.flownative.com) customer in order to use Local Beach because Local Beach is
free (as in free beer, or free coffee).

This README currently only contains basic information about Local Beach. You may find more information on the 
[Local Beach website](https://www.flownative.com/localbeach.html). 

These are the [setup instructions](https://www.flownative.com/en/documentation/guides/localbeach/local-beach-setup-docker-based-neos-development-howto.html) for Local Beach.
Currently, automatic installation via Homebrew is supported.

tldr;

```
brew tap flownative/flownative
brew install localbeach
beach version
``` 

## Internals

Some random notes about the internals of Local Beach:

- `beach setup` is automatically invoked by Homebrew when Local Beach is installed
- the base path for Local Beach is `~/Library/Application Support/Flownative/Local Beach/` on macOS and 
  `~/.Flownative/Local Beach/` on other systems

## Build

To build the binary, run `make`. It does this:

```bash
rm -f assets/compiled.go
go generate -v
go install -v
go build -v -ldflags "-X github.com/flownative/localbeach/pkg/version.Version=dev" -o beach
``` 

For a slightly quicker build, use `make compile`.
